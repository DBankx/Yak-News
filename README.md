This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About YakNews
This is a very simple news app that displays news gotten from the news api. news uses both react for the ui and redux for the state managenment

### run on local
to begin clone this file into your system then run
```
npm install
```
to install all the dependencies needed for the project.
Then you will need a new york times api key, an open weather app api key and a news api key.. once done getting those and placing them in a .env file... run
```
npm start
```
to start the project

### note
the app does not work fully on the website because the news api needs a paid version for it to supply data to other domains apart from local host, so for the app to run fully it needs some paid content

### license
this app holds a MIT lisence
